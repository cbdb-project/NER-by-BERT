The Code file stores Python codes mainly doing 2 tasks:

1. The JinNER.ipynb Notebook is the training and predict code. You can directly run the code in the Notebook to perform the NER task on Jin data.
2. Code in PythonScript serves as the data transformation module. the NERed data is saved as .txt files. PythonScript code transform them into xml pages that are readable by Markus.
